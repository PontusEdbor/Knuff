# Knuff
My basic puzzle game

# The simple game plan:
You control a square.
You push boxes and collect coins to advance in levels of increasing difficulty.

# Controls
You control the direciton of the square by tapping the edges of the screen.
Since the game will be played on widescreen devices the left/right controls will be placed on top of the up/down controls.
